        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        Each of you will represent a firm. Both firms manufacture the same product.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two of you decide simultaneously and independently how many units to manufacture.
        Your choices can be any number from 0 to {{ Constants.R }}.
        All produced units will be sold, but the more is produced, the lower the unit selling price will be.
    </p>


{#    <p>#}
{#        The unit selling price is:#}
{#    </p>#}

{#    <ul>#}
{#        <strong>Unit selling price = {{ Constants.total_capacity }} – Units produced by your firm – Units produced by the other firm</strong>#}
{#    </ul>#}

    <p>
        Your profit, measured in points, is therefore:

    <ul>
        <strong>Your fitness function = {{ Constants.pR }} - {{ player.get_fitness_function_to_string }}.</strong>
    </ul>
